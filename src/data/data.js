      "This is a very complete app where you can manage simple finance, after you create an account, you may add/edit/delete: Incomes, Expenses, Debts or Stock. There's a month filter, as well as a dark-mode and a language switch between english and spanish. It has a simple yet modern flat design made with SasS and few animations made with framer-motion. React's state was worked with Redux, finally I implemented Firebase as backend. On Login there's a Demo button to view the app without creating an account. Responsive design.",

      "Different to previous Spotify clone. This one does not use Spotify's API to validate an account so you may create one. It has a music player and since it does not work with Spotify's API, You can even reproduce music (Rock playlist is recomended ðŸ¤˜). I tried to simulate the actual Spotify app's UI, but I also chose to change few interface elements. It is not completely functional, e.g. Search bar is just ornamentary, as playlist links on the sidebar. To be entirely honest you can find few bugs on the audio player, but none to disprove the hard work on this free-of-ads music player (more info on App Info button on sidebar). Responsive design.",

      "This is a very similar UI to Amazon's app. The functionalities are to create an account, add items to basket, proceed to checkout and finally to online-payment screen. Payments are treated with Stripe, you can even pay for the items not with an actual card (of course) but just fill the Card Number, CVC, month/year and Postal Code with 4242424242...... to the end and 'payment' will be done (there's no shipping though ðŸ˜‚), now there's a 'Orders' tab to see what you purchased.

And since only premium users are validated to play music, the player is disabled. The project seed the will to make a beter and functional Spotify's clone, that you may see above. Not responsive ",
